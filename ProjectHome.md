This library is developed for the Horter I2C modules (http://horter.de/) but should work for other digital input/output modules based on the PCF8574 too but hasn't been tested.

There is also sample code that shows how to use the library and how to use the interrupt feature of the input module.

All tested on a Raspberry Pi.
